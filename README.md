## Assignment Content
  . HTML5 Basics
Document Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It tells the browser that the page is using HTML5.
<html>: This tag encompasses the entire HTML document.
<head>: Contains metadata about the document, like the title, link to CSS files, and other metadata tags.
<body>: This is where the actual content of the web page goes—texts, images, links, etc.
Core Elements:

Headings: Tags <h1> to <h6> are used to define headings. <h1> is the main heading, while <h2> to <h6> are sub-headings.
Paragraphs: The <p> tag is used for paragraphs.
Lists:
Ordered Lists: <ol> for numbered lists.
Unordered Lists: <ul> for bulleted lists.
List Items: <li> tags inside <ol> or <ul>.
Links: <a href="URL"> creates hyperlinks to navigate between pages or sites.
Images: The <img> tag is used to embed images, with the src attribute pointing to the image source and the alt attribute describing the image for accessibility.

2. Semantic HTML
Semantic Tags:

<header>: Represents the introductory content or navigation links of a page or section.
<footer>: Defines the footer section of a page, usually containing copyright info, contact links, etc.
<nav>: Used for defining navigation links, making it easier for screen readers and search engines to identify navigational areas.
<section>: Represents a section of content in a page. Typically used for grouping related content.
<article>: Defines a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
Why Semantic Elements Matter:

Improved Readability: Semantic tags make the content structure clearer, which benefits both users and developers.
SEO: Search engines like Google use semantic HTML to better understand the content of a page, potentially improving ranking.
Accessibility: These tags help screen readers and other assistive technologies navigate the page, making the web more accessible.
3. Accessibility and SEO Basics
Accessibility:

Alt Text: Use the alt attribute in <img> tags to describe images. This helps users who rely on screen readers or in cases when the image doesn't load.
Title and ARIA Labels: For links and interactive elements, use the title attribute to give users extra information on what the element does. Additionally, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels can improve accessibility.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure that users can navigate and interact with your site using only the keyboard (e.g., providing proper tabbing order).
SEO-Friendly Practices:

Semantic Structure: Use meaningful tags like <article>, <header>, and <nav> to clearly define your page’s layout and content hierarchy.
Meta Tags: The <meta> tags in the <head> section provide search engines with important information about the content of the page (e.g., descriptions, keywords).
URLs and Links: Use clear, descriptive URLs and avoid unnecessary parameters. Internal linking is also important for SEO, so users and search engines can navigate your site easily.
Responsive Design: Making sure your website works well on all devices can improve your SEO, as search engines favor mobile-friendly sites.
